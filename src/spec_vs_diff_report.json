  "missing_requirements": [

      "id": "REQ-16",
      "requirement": "Perform a production deployment that updates both the backend canister code and the frontend assets so production reflects the working fix (Home “Show Me Encouragement” navigates to Encouragement and displays content), without breaking Internet Identity auth or existing user state.",
      "reason": "The diff contains code changes and a new deployment guide, but no evidence of an executed production deployment or concrete production deployment configuration changes (e.g., dfx.json/canister IDs/network configs/CI release steps) is shown in the provided diff summary. The new DEPLOYMENT.md file is truncated and does not demonstrate that production was actually updated.",
