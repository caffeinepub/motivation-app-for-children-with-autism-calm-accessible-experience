# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Deploy the latest working build to production so the production app reflects the recent fix to the “Show Me Encouragement” flow.

**Planned changes:**
- Deploy the latest backend canister code to production.
- Deploy the latest frontend assets to production.
- Verify in production that the Home “Show Me Encouragement” button navigates to the Encouragement screen and displays encouragement content.

**User-visible outcome:** In the production app, users can successfully use the “Show Me Encouragement” button from the Home screen to reach the Encouragement screen and see encouragement content, without disrupting Internet Identity login or existing user data/state.
